# Memoir
My history of 50 years in Information Technology

The stories from high-lights and low-lights of working in the Information Technology sector from 1969 to 2024.

A long and wonderful ride!

I hope these stories are an enjoyable read.

In addition to this core story, there are "Personal (mostly NSFW)" and "Classified/Confidential"
stories.  Just get in contact with me to get access to them if you are interested.

I will be publishing the stories of My History of Code Generation and Computer Emulators in the near future. I hope.

Thank you for reading!
