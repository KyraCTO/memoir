# Memoir
My history of 50 years in Information Technology

The stories from high-lights and low-lights of working in the Information Technology sector from 1969 to 2024.

A long and wonderful ride!

I hope these stories are an enjoyable read.

In addition to this core story, there are "Personal (mostly NSFW)" and "Classified/Confidential"
stories.  Just get in contact with me to get access to them if you are interested.

"The Human Navigator" is an article about my recommended approach to using AI in software development.

"Foundation of Boolean Logic" and "Simple As Possible One" are companion documents to the Ben Eater computer kit, and I hope they help you learn how computers actually work.

I will be publishing the stories of My History of Code Generation and Computer Emulators in the near future. I hope.

Thank you for reading!
